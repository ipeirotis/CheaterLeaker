ERP-Test-208	184866	Which module of the ERP system is typically the driving force for switching away from the legacy systems in search of better functionality?	The human resources module	The information technology module	The accounting module	The payroll module<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184867	Why would employees in the accounting department not be allowed to access the payroll module?	So that they may not be able to see sensitive data. They need only to see the accounting impact of the payroll which they can see through the accounting module	So that they may not be able to determine how many employees work for the company	So that they may not be able to see what the current payroll tax percentages are	So that they may not be able to get a copy of the company organization chart<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184868	How does the manufacturing process module impact the accounting module?	Head count from the manufacturing department affect accounting allocations.	Employee wages of the manufacturing employees are posted to the general ledger.	As an item is produced and moves through the manufacturing process, direct and indirect costs impact the general ledger.	Financial reports need to be created in order to facilitate the manufacturing department.<br>

ERP-Test-208	184872	How does the ERP system know which general ledger accounts to credit and debit based on the type of entry made into the system?	They are predetermined by the ERP software vendor and companies must adopt their GL structure.	All entries go into a suspense account that an accountant must code correctly at month end.	All possibilities for entry are mapped to specific codes during the implementation phase.	Each user must be trained in general ledger coding conventions and manually enter them for each transaction.<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184873	Which of the following is typically not a unique module?	Accounting	Customer relationship management	Accounts payable	Purchasing<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184874	Why would an accounting employee need access to the manufacturing module?	To get the head count of manufacturing employees	To determine the current payroll tax rate	To get the list of employees	To look at specific financial data related to work orders<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184875	Which of the following is an advantage of having centralized data in an ERP system?	It enables the users not to share data with other departments.	It creates additional work for the employees by way of coordinating their data.	It eliminates the need to enter information into multiple systems.	It enables the employees to view the payroll module and see what other people are earning.<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184876	Why is an ERP system not suitable for all companies?	It is more efficient to use several individual software packages.	Employees have a difficult time switching over to the new system.	It has some short term disadvantages even though long term benefits outweigh them.	It can be expensive and provides more functionality than is needed by smaller companies.<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184877	How do switching costs affect a company once an ERP system is implemented?	It is easy to switch over from one ERP system to a different one as implementation costs are low.	"Once employees learn one ERP system, they can use any ERP system; so switching costs are low."	They are prohibitive and make it difficult to change to a different system frequently.	"It is expensive to maintain ERP systems; so switching over to a lower tier system is beneficial.<br>"		
ERP-Test-208	184878	What level of detail can a person using an ERP system view profitability, assuming the system has been set up to facilitate reporting on the most detailed level?	By cost center	By product line	Only at the profit & loss statement, companywide level	At a granular level, for a specific item<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184879	What do transaction identification numbers allow to be done?	To time stamp transactions	To specifically identify who performed an entry or transaction in the ERP system, and all consequences related to it	To show the general ledger coding of a transaction<br>			
ERP-Test-208	184880	Why is there often resistance from employees to adopting a new ERP system?	They do not receive any of the benefits of the new system, but have to learn it.	They do not want the company to spend money on a new system.	They prefer to work harder and longer hours.	They feel it creates an unfair advantage over competitors.<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184881	Why can the interconnected nature of data between different departments in an ERP system be a disadvantage?	It facilitates the flow of information.	It reduces input error since data can be used by several departments.	Employees in one department do not want to share information with others and resist utilizing the full functionality of the system.	It reduces the flow of information between departments.<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184882	Which of the following is a way to create increased security in the ERP system against employee tampering of data?	Allow employees access to all modules to create an open environment	Limit the number of employees with access to ten or fewer	Allow employees access only to the modules and functions they need for their specific jobs	Create a strict audit routine where the management regularly audits employee transactions<br>		
ERP-Test-208	184883	Why is the security measure of not allowing the deletion of information sometimes a disadvantage?	Employees can not cover up mistakes they make.	The management can see what errors are being frequently made and help employees learn to avoid them.	A mistake can be traced back to a specific entry and employee.	"Employees create ""work arounds"" to fix problems when their access is limited, which often causes more problems if they do not understand the full impact of what they are doing.<br>"		
ERP-Test-208	184884	Why does having all employees of a company use the same ERP system, enhance the efficiency of the business?	Having all employees on one system allows for faster system response.	All the employees can duplicate data entries in the same system.	Everyone is utilizing the same data and can view it in real time.	The management can create their own reports and reduce the burden on the staff.<br>
